1773. Count Items Matching a Rule

ou are given an array items, where each items[i] = [typei, colori, namei] describes the type, color, and name of the ith item. You are also given a rule represented by two strings, ruleKey and ruleValue.

The ith item is said to match the rule if one of the following is true:

ruleKey == "type" and ruleValue == typei.
ruleKey == "color" and ruleValue == colori.
ruleKey == "name" and ruleValue == namei.
Return the number of items that match the given rule.

Example 1:

Input: items = [["phone","blue","pixel"],["computer","silver","lenovo"],["phone","gold","iphone"]], ruleKey = "color", ruleValue = "silver"
Output: 1
Explanation: There is only one item matching the given rule, which is ["computer","silver","lenovo"].

class Solution:
    def countMatches(self, items: List[List[str]], ruleKey: str, ruleValue: str) -> int:
        count = 0
        for item in items:
            value = ''
            if ruleKey == "type":
                value = item[0]
            if ruleKey == "color":
                value = item[1]
            if ruleKey == "name":
                value = item[2]
            if value == ruleValue:
                count += 1
        return count
