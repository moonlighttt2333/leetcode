Given an array of meeting time intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], return the minimum number of conference rooms required.

 

Example 1:

Input: intervals = [[0,30],[5,10],[15,20]]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: intervals = [[7,10],[2,4]]
Output: 1

class Solution:
    def minMeetingRooms(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        rooms = []
        intervals.sort()
        for meeting in intervals:
            put = False
            for r in rooms:
                if r[-1][1] <= meeting[0]:
                    # put meeting in room r
                    r.append(meeting)
                    put = True
                    break
            if not put:

PriorityQueue (heapq, heap queue or priority queue)

Heaps are binary trees for which every parent node has a value less than or equal to any of its children.
This implementation uses arrays for which heap[k] <= heap[2*k+1] and heap[k] <= heap[2*k+2] for all k, 
counting elements from zero. For the sake of comparison, non-existing elements are considered to be infinite. 
The interesting property of a heap is that its smallest element is always the root, heap[0].


class Solution:
    def minMeetingRooms(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        
        # If there is no meeting to schedule then no room needs to be allocated.
        if not intervals:
            return 0

        # The heap initialization
        free_rooms = []

        # Sort the meetings in increasing order of their start time.
        intervals.sort(key= lambda x: x[0])

        # Add the first meeting. We have to give a new room to the first meeting.
        heapq.heappush(free_rooms, intervals[0][1])

        # For all the remaining meeting rooms
        for i in intervals[1:]:

            # If the room due to free up the earliest is free, assign that room to this meeting.
            if free_rooms[0] <= i[0]:
                heapq.heappop(free_rooms)

            # If a new room is to be assigned, then also we add to the heap,
            # If an old room is allocated, then also we have to add to the heap with updated end time.
            heapq.heappush(free_rooms, i[1])

        # The size of the heap tells us the minimum rooms required for all the meetings.
        return len(free_rooms)
