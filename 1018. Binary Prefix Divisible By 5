Given an array nums of 0s and 1s, consider xi: the i-th subarray from nums[0] to nums[i] interpreted as a binary number (from most-significant-bit to least-significant-bit.)

Return a list of booleans answer, where answer[i] is true if and only if xi is divisible by 5.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [0,1,1]
Output: [true,false,false]
Explanation: 
The input numbers in binary are 0, 01, 011; which are 0, 1, and 3 in base-10.  Only the first number is divisible by 5, so answer[0] is true.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,1,1]
Output: [false,false,false]

class Solution:
    def prefixesDivBy5(self, A: List[int]) -> List[bool]:
        n = 0
        ret = []
        for b in A:
            n *= 2
            if b == 1:
                n += 1

            ret.append(n % 5 == 0)
        return ret
