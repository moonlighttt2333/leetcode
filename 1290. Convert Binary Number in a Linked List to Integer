Given head which is a reference node to a singly-linked list. The value of each node in the linked list is either 0 or 1. The linked list holds the binary representation of a number.

Return the decimal value of the number in the linked list.

Input: head = [1,0,1]
Output: 5
Explanation: (101) in base 2 = (5) in base 10

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def getDecimalValue(self, head: ListNode) -> int:
        val = 0
        base = 2
        
        while head:
            val = val * base + head.val
            head = head.next
        return val
