Given a binary array, find the maximum number of consecutive 1s in this array.

Example 1:

Input: [1,1,0,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s.
    The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.
    
class Solution:
    def findMaxConsecutiveOnes(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        consec_flag = True
        max_consec = 0
        consec_num = 0
        for n in nums:
            if n == 1:
                consec_num += 1
                if max_consec < consec_num:
                    max_consec = consec_num
            else:
                consec = False
                consec_num = 0
        return max_consec
