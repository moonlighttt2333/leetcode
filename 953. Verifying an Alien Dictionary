In an alien language, surprisingly they also use english lowercase letters, but possibly in a different order. The order of the alphabet is some permutation of lowercase letters.

Given a sequence of words written in the alien language, and the order of the alphabet, return true if and only if the given words are sorted lexicographicaly in this alien language.

 

Example 1:

Input: words = ["hello","leetcode"], order = "hlabcdefgijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: true
Explanation: As 'h' comes before 'l' in this language, then the sequence is sorted.
Example 2:

Input: words = ["word","world","row"], order = "worldabcefghijkmnpqstuvxyz"
Output: false
Explanation: As 'd' comes after 'l' in this language, then words[0] > words[1], hence the sequence is unsorted.

        dt = {}
        for i, char in enumerate(order):
            dt[char] = i
        
        # check whether the words are sorted
        pre = 0
        for i, word in enumerate(words):
            if dt[word[0]] > pre or i == 0:
                # compare the first character 
                pre = dt[word[0]]
                continue
            else:
                # compare other charaters
                j = 0
                while j < len(word) and j < len(words[i-1]) and word[j] == words[i-1][j]:
                    j += 1
                if j >= len(word) and j < len(words[i-1]):
                    # later word is shoter
                    return False
                elif j >= len(words[i-1]):
                    # previous word is shorter
                    continue
                elif dt[words[i-1][j]] > dt[word[j]]:
                    return False
